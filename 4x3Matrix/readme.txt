A simple 4 in, 3 out Matrix mixer in 10HP.

It's designed to be an easy build as a first SMD project, with 0805 resistors with plenty of space inbetween.

The four inputs can be mixed in a three different ways for three different outputs.

The mixer is DC coupled, so can be used for both CV and audio.

Some examples:

- Mix four cv signals to three different outputs
- Create feedback loops, patching one output back into an input. 
By patching multiple feedback loops you can create complex audio signals and waveshaping. 
Patching effects like delays inbetween can produce infinite feedback.

- For output A turn down input 3 and 4. For output B turn down input 1 and 2. Now you have two independent 2 channel mixers. 
You could use one as a CV attenuator and the other for mixing audio.
